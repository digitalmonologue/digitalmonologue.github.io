Currently based out of the San Francisco Bay Area 🌉. You can find me working in Menlo Park, California, or when I am visiting friends and family every now and again in Sydney, Australia 🐨.

I am a graduate with a Bachelor of Commerce/Science from the University of New South Wales and an online Master of Science in Analytics from Georgia Tech 📓, spending my time on personal projects 🎨 and working full time 💻.
